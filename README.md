Data Engineering Assignment Solution
This repository contains my solutions to a comprehensive data engineering assignment.
The assignment covers various aspects of data handling, modeling, analysis, and processing using Python, SQL, and Apache Spark. 



Overview
This assignment was designed to simulate real-world data engineering challenges, including:

Data Modeling: Designing star-schema / snowflake schema models for an e-commerce platform.
SQL Queries: Writing SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.
ETL Processes: Loading and transforming nested JSON data into normalized tables.
Streaming Data: Ingesting JSON files using Apache Spark Structured Streaming.
Time Series Analysis: Analyzing multitasking data from AGI bots to identify work periods and activities.


Tasks and Solutions
Data Modeling:

Designed a comprehensive star-schema / snowflake schema model for an e-commerce platform.
Implemented in SQL and generated sample data to populate the model.
SQL Queries:

Created SQL queries to retrieve insights such as top customers, sales trends, and product performance metrics.
ETL Processes:

Loaded and transformed nested JSON data into normalized tables using Python (Pandas) and SQL.
Streaming Data:

Used Apache Spark Structured Streaming to ingest JSON files from cloud storage.
Automatically inferred schema and handled new file additions.
Time Series Analysis:

Processed AGI bot multitasking data to identify continuous work periods and aggregate activities.
